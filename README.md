# Robust-Heading-Estimation-by-Optimum-Axes-Mapping
This research proposes an accurate and robust heading estimation based on optimum axes mapping by fusing accelerometer and magnetometer sensor readings.

It consists of 10 datasets for 10 experimental settings:
1. In-hand, screen reading
2. On-call, held to the ear (right side)
3. On-call, held to the ear (left side)
4. In-pocket, right front pants pocket (screen facing body)
5. In-pocket, right front pants pocket (screen facing outwards)
6. In-pocket, left front pants pocket (screen facing body)
7. In-pocket, left front pants pocket (screen facing outwards)
8. In-pocket, right rear pants pocket (screen facing body)
9. In-pocket, right rear pants pocket (screen facing outwards)
10. Swaying, right hand (screen facing body)

In particular, a pedestrian walked outdoors, around 110 meters in a relatively straight-line motion, aiming to maintain a constant heading direction. The pedestrian walked on asphalt concrete in a parking lot. The same location and direction were used for each experiment, i.e., in-hand screen reading, on-call on
both the right and left sides, in-pocket on the left and right pants pockets, and the rear pants pocket as well as swaying in the right hand while walking.

This research was submitted for acceptance at the 15th International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN) 2025, Tempere, Finland
Constantina Isaia and Michalis P. Michaelides (2024). “Robust-Heading-Estimation-by-Optimum-Axes-Mapping”.
